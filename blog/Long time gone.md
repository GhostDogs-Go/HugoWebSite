# Long time gone

It's been a long time since I have posted anything. Not that I haven't wanted to say anything or had anything to write about, it's just been a real difficult time for Tam and myself. I have been writing a journal twice a day to try to get a handle on things but to be honest what I have written in that journal I would not post. So right now I have decided to post a few new things to bring Tam's journey up to date. So over the next week I will be posting an update on how things have been with Tam.

In the meantime some new photos,
